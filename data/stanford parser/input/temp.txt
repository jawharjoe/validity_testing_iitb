510:There is no better place to begin than with countries refusing to join the UNEP Convention or kowtow to its ban on DDT use.
511:Myanmar has already paid an extremely high price for its isolation.
512:Sequence data, whether from proteins or nucleic acids, are well suited to computer processing because they are easily digitized and broken down into their constituent units.
513:Projecting stability and security in these countries is the next logical step in building a Europe "whole and free" and securing the Euro-Atlantic community's eastern frontier with the Middle East.
514:Formerly, the state decided everything, and many people, particularly in the middle and older generation, began to see freedom as a burden, because it entailed continuous decision-making.
515:But acknowledging the East Europeans' dilemma is in no way to forgive Chirac's arrogant blow against the unity of the Continent as a whole.
516:This would truly be the end of ideology at last, were it not for the new challenges arising from the temptations of various kinds of fundamentalism.
517:America Wakes Up to Climate Change
518:Indeed, the role of the state is made more complicated by the fact that market regulation is becoming less national and more transnational.
519:One is "institutional conditionality:" only governments that show serious progress in reducing inefficiency, robbery of public property and corruption, should receive aid.
520:The international financial system is broken down in the sense that it fails to provide adequate capital to countries that need it most and qualify for it.
521:Only through this process will Serbia be able to rejoin the ranks of free and healthy European nations.
522:But the poisoned atmosphere that followed the UN debates on Iraq may prevent the US from getting its way here.
523:Many in the Bush Administration argue that aggressive policies toward Iraq can ultimately bring down autocratic governments in the Middle East the same way that the Reagan Administration supposedly brought down the "evil" Soviet empire.
524:Imagine that the Olympic Committee represented only the interests of gold medal winners, or that the Education Ministry represented only post-doctoral programs but ignored elementary schools.
525:Of course, the legitimacy of the government or other policymaking body will determine what is possible in economic policymaking.
526:The overlap between the end of the accession process and heated discussions about the new European Constitution played into the hands of the opposition.
527:Yet, although some of the Kremlin's moves seem clear and reasonable, others can scarcely be described as rational or forward-looking.
528:In the future, especially without Sistani, who is 74 years old, the new regime could turn into a dictatorship.
529:Putin is swiftly eroding the great authority he built up during his first term.
530:Instead, a populist-nationalist revolution might resemble the attempt to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, or a Russian version of Ukraine's Orange Revolution.
531:This is not to say that wage insurance is a bad idea, or that it should not be implemented on a wider scale.
532:This should be matched by the creation of "supply capacities" in developing countries, which requires production and trade sector policies that encourage structural transformation.
533:Even the venerable Congress party - which led India's struggle for independence - manipulates religious, communal and caste rivalries so as to boost its chances of forming government.
534:Second, with rare exceptions, there is no international police force that can assist a defending nation.
535:But most importantly, European integration must not only define institutions and policies, but it must also galvanise ideas.
536:Of course, there is a big hole in the Dow 36,000 logic.
537:The problem is that, although Africa's economic appeal is increasing, India and China are improving more quickly, widening the gap.
538:Mahmoud Abbas, Arafat's longtime deputy and the architect of the Oslo accords, quickly secured the backing of Fatah, the PLO's core body.
539:"It should not be left to gays alone to fight for gay rights, because we are talking about fundamental violations of justice," Attafuah said.
540:Of course, it is important that Russia becomes less dependent on energy exports.
541:The same is true of all games played at the final tournament, not only those among the top eight national teams.
542:The monarchy was overthrown in 1952 without violence, and for 250 years Egypt has shown itself capable of producing both radical and reformist political trends.
543:But even as evidence for such abuses becomes apparent, new venues for abuse are repeatedly opened up - take the US repeal of the Glass Steagall Act, which separated commercial from investment banking.
544:It would also provide Afghan peasants, who have been growing poppy despite forced eradication of the plant and incentives to change crops, with an option that is regulated by law and that, in time, could have an impact on the heroin trade.
545:Russia is, in fact, the main provider of energy insecurity in Europe.
546:But this does not hold true in all countries or all age groups, so other factors must be influential, too.
547:In 2002, the Hartz Commission recommended a version of it in Germany.
548:There are countless other possibilities.
549:Neutrality prevented them from becoming candidates so long as the Soviet Union existed.
550:Far from disappearing, the repressed are returning from underground in grotesque forms to haunt the world they grew up in.
551:The days and nights ahead will be difficult, and the secret presence of Russian troops will make them all the more dangerous.
552:Of course, Japan did occupy China, committed unimaginable savagery, and has since paid no reparations or apologized in a convincing way.

557:Few other areas in the world have been deemed an "economic miracle" for so long.
558:Yet the IMF was still lobbying to change its charter in order to force countries to liberalize their capital markets, ignoring the evidence that this did not lead to enhanced growth or more investment, but only to more instability.
559:In an era of evaporated pensions and benefits for the rank and file, piggish pay packets for CEO's have led a cynical public to wonder where big business has gone wrong.
560:His network was dispersed throughout the world and had been attacking American interests for years.
561:Freeing up capital flows had an inexorable logic -- or so it seemed. Developing nations, the argument went, have plenty of investment opportunities, but are short of savings.
562:Despite the importance of Cyprus, it is the possible war with Iraq that poses the most severe test of the delicate balance that now exists between Turkey's conservative old guard and the more liberal reformers within the ruling Justice and Development Party.
563:There have also been reports, more often on the Internet than in the press, about despairing Lebanese doctors, who, not recognizing the wounds patients have sustained after Israeli air strikes, have described what they see and asked colleagues around the world for help.
564:This is particularly true when their objective is to establish an "alternative" to American leadership in security policy.
565:During the 1990's, private investors looked at big, lumbering central banks as cash cows, long on money and short on financial acumen.
566:Eight of the new members are former Communist countries that were locked behind the Iron Curtain for nearly half a century.
567:Later, Phelps developed a long-term growth theory based on education and technical advances.
568:Surely a more competent administration would be worried about addressing these more severe and urgent fiscal problems.
569:Global warming is a case in point.
570:Indeed, stock prices doubled compared to profits.
571:But where do these differences in attitude toward fundamental issues like inequality come from?
572:What this distinct contribution could be is not difficult to define.
573:Moreover, the economy-wide productivity gap between the US and Western Europe does not appear to be widening very rapidly, if at all.
574:It is not surprising that the triumph of the PC seemed to be accompanied by a revival of the nineteenth-century vision of classical liberalism and individualism.
575:Indeed, many opposition groups engaged in dirty tricks.
576:Most dramatically, more Mexicans than ever before are risking their lives and paying up to $3,000 to enter the "promised land."
577:Like the Clintons, the Kirchners knew from early on in their marriage that they wanted to reach the top, and the best way to do it, they concluded, was together.
578:Nevertheless, electricity usage has reached near-record levels.
579:Argentina achieved per capita economic growth of just 0.5% during 1980-1998, while Korea grew at a rate of 6.2% per year, fueled by its high-technology exports.
580:The only scenario in which there could be a strong, purely economic case for Euro membership is one in which the Euro-zone is doing very well, the British economy is doing very badly, and membership looks like the best way to deliver long-term recovery.
581:These initial considerations cover only a small range of the conceivable environmental effects of the Iraq war.
582:A half-century of working together, plus a decade and a half of adapting to new threats and demands, is paying off.
583:Worse yet, markets will be carved up for political, not commercial, reasons, locking in inefficiencies.
584:Iranians yearn for reform, reflected in President Khatami's two landslide electoral victories.
585:Sometimes the RCB acted as the government's banker, providing liquidity without considering the financial markets; at other times, it focused on the financial markets, providing liquidity to banks.
586:That issue and the unresolved Palestine-Israel debacle are holding off immediate action.
587:Dr. Khan's televised confession and acceptance of sole responsibility for proliferation activities has done nothing to reduced suspicion that there is more here than meets the eye, and of the Pakistani military's complicity in proliferation.
588:They must be embedded in a much more complex institutional framework, which I would describe as the liberal order.
589:Some measures -- unauthorized searches of bank records and wiretapping of telephone calls -- compromise the liberty of all.
590:Such a pattern is a formula for endless conflict and endless defeat.
591:Nonetheless, there is a creeping perception that the OSCE is becoming too deeply engaged in picking winners and losers in Albanian politics - a perception underpinned by wider questions of sovereignty.
592:"Arkan," the leader of the most murderous paramilitary group in the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, and a political power even after Milosevic's fall, was murdered in Belgrade last year.
593:As these examples suggest, today's information age has been marked by the growing role of non-governmental organizations (NGO's) on the international stage.
594:But there are far more important issues -- above all, freedom of speech, including the freedom to say and write things that annoy, even upset, many.
595:Indeed, this year's annual session of the Academy of Military Sciences saw army commanders and military theorists try to prove that a future source of conflict will be America's desire to control the world's oil-rich regions.
596:No one should doubt that Kuchma intends to stay in power, no matter what.
597:All forecasts, after all, turn out to be wrong in at least one vital dimension.
598:If, however, such advantages were dramatic and mainly determined by biological change, we should expect to find them reflected in the material culture produced by these early, anatomically modern populations.
599:How much restraint is justified?
600:But, if we're ready to rush the pandemic strain into an emergency program to manufacture vaccine, we could possibly blunt the second wave.
601:After a long winter and a non-existent spring, summer started promptly with the first kick-off -- and virtually overnight, Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side.
602:As already proposed by the Convention, this would mean separating constitutional matters per se from Union policy.
603:Two weeks ago, North Korea declared that in June it successfully reprocessed some 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods and now possesses "nuclear deterrence," suggesting that Kim Jong Il's regime may actually be making atomic bombs.
604:Furthermore, the degree of rigidity in inter-ethnic negotiations since the rise to power of the Bandaranaike family (of which the current President is a member) was accompanied by a series of ideological struggles among Sinhalese politicians, not least those led by various socialist and communist parties.
605:Lethality has been increasing.
606:But many within Moscow's political elite still consider Belarus an integral part of Russia, which it was -- with only short interruptions -- since 1795.
607:In writing to Merkel, he is addressing the leader of a country decimated by Nazi rule -- millions dead, an entire society and economy reduced to rubble.
608:It results in mass unemployment that is inefficient and financially unsustainable.
609:There are a number of qualities that must be understood if integration is to continue to build an ever more open Europe.
610:Monnet's effort to rebuild France by mobilizing business, unions and government authorities at all levels mutated into France's "Great Organizational Myth"- the idea that technocrats can allocate resources better than the market.
611:We recognize, of course, that few of even the most fervent supporters of European integration want to help Ukraine quickly become a member.
612:They saved the banking systems, modernized telecommunications networks, rebuilt ailing industries, raised the quality of goods, and undermined the cozy vested interests that had robbed ordinary citizens for decades.
613:It must be distributed to the needy rather than favoring the elite - a tendency established in the past.
614:The IMF is absolutely right to remind ministers each April of downside risks.
615:In second place is The Myths of Argentine History, Volume One .
616:Auschwitz did not occur in a vacuum. It was the furthest extreme of a disaster that incorporated all these other events.
617:As Walid Jumblatt, the Lebanese Druze leader said, "It's strange for me to say it, but this process of change has started because of the American invasion of Iraq."
618:What's appealing about that?
619:A trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why.
620:Yet with the richest countries richer than ever before, and with much of the developing world already escaped from the horrors of extreme poverty, the balance has shifted in favor of ending global poverty.
621:Smart politicians understood that the balance of political costs and benefits had shifted dramatically, and they changed gears fast.
622:The question is whether future American military missions will replicate those of the past five years. 
623:In a new, unstable century, the relationship between Europe and America is more important than ever.
624:But in most cases, entry strategies have been set, serving as important stabilizers for financial markets and economic agents.

626:IMF and World Bank structural adjustment policies combining trade liberalization with tight monetary policy were supposed to redirect resources from less productive to more productive uses.
627:For the past 50 years, the EU was largely able to count on a benign partnership with the US in a multilateral context; that assumption no longer holds, even if we do not yet know the extent of America's new unilateralism.
628:In essence, the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept.
629:But the behavior of consumer prices in the post-1980 crises is fundamentally different from that seen in the 1930's.
630:For, by taking the steps called for in the Nuclear Posture Review--specifically, developing "new capabilities...to defeat emerging threats," including "extensive research and timely fielding of new systems to address these challenges"--the Bush administration is lowering the threshold for the possible use of nuclear weapons by the US or other countries.
631:We do not know whether Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and/or President Jacques Chirac called Berlusconi to suggest that he find a new Italian Commissioner.
632:In September, Bush made an unexpectedly low-key speech to the UN General Assembly.
633:China has similar problems, with the investment-growth nexus threatening macroeconomic stability -- witness the overheating that occurred in 2003 and 2004.
634:Or is it?
635:Milosevic, the former president of Yugoslavia, and then Serbia, died in prison.
636:Drug trafficking, money laundering and economic crimes are areas where the two countries are already working together, for there is now greater understanding of their respective positions, and also shared interests, on these issues.
637:One reason is that terrorism is typically organized activity.
638:This is, unfortunately, a fair description of what underlies the relationship between NATO and the Russian Federation.
639:The inventor of New Labour would like to be remembered as the man who squared the circle of sustainable economic growth and a reformed welfare state, the man who reconciled wealth creation and social cohesion.
640:Russia's extreme activism is curious.
641:As the world sinks into slowdown, several policy lessons emerge.
642:But the risk to EU gas supplies shows that our fates are linked.
643:Under the influence of market fundamentalism, the IMF does not benefit all of its members sufficiently.
644:The process of integration was reversed after the WWI and finally destroyed in the Great Depression, in a series of vicious shocks: tariff protection, contagious financial panics that spread from the periphery to the heart of the world's financial system, and a turn to economic nationalism and autarky.
645:This is where the inspectors have focused so far.
646:One source of discontent with globalization is that it deprives countries of their freedom to protect their economy and citizens.
647:In 1980, stock market capitalization relative to GDP was five times greater in the US and UK than in Continental Europe; by 2000, it was only 60% higher.
648:Some of these events stemmed from Gorbachev's miscalculations.
649:The Indians Strike Back
650:So how does such a system block offending content?
651:Party caucuses, decisions of party executive committees, and party congresses assume the status of public institutions with informal authority to block government policy.
652:It might not be able to close the Strait of Hormuz, but threats to refineries, storage facilities, and tankers would send oil prices even higher.
653:Asia's Age of Thaksin?
654:They could well squander the significant transfers that they receive through the agricultural and structural funds, as many previous EU recipients did.
655:These include the haunting celebration of a young man's imminent martyrdom by suicide bombing, while other websites, although less violent, have widened the scope of sin to include learning English, studying science, and giving women access to the Internet without a male guardian present.
656:The Gulf War of 1991 demonstrated that wars can actually be bad for an economy.
657:Everyone feels that a seismic shift is under way.
658:A Global Agreement on Basic Telecommunications went into effect in 1998; a Financial Services Agreement to liberalize trade in banking, insurance, and securities was implemented in April 1999.
659:Consider pharmaceuticals. For American drug companies, this agreement extends the time period during which brand-name pharmaceuticals have exclusive access to markets, postponing the entry of generic drugs and thus limiting competition.
660:What other exit strategy can it devise?
661:Anyone who now claims that the 1948 Palestinian refugees have a claim, in principle, to return to Israel, must confront the question: should the millions of Germans expelled from Eastern Europe after 1945 also have the same right of return to their lost homes?
662:This task requires time, patience, hard work, and luck.
663:Consider one example: the number of children per woman in society, known as the ``total fertility rate.'' In societies where women are not allowed to work and are expected to remain home and raise children, the number of children is very high.
664:But these are the people least likely to take their tax cuts and spend them to boost aggregate demand.
665:The release of Milosevic?
666:When private jobs are no longer competitive, government jobs seem an easy solution to keeping people employed.
667:We should be prepared for them.

671:The alliance between Syria and Iran dates back more than two decades, and was explicitly reaffirmed by the two ruling regimes as recently as January 2005.
672:Education ministries in Brazil, Uganda, and throughout many parts of the developing world know what works.
673:Leaving aside all questions of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, Russia is just too big, too Asiatic, too nuclear, and too much of a "great power," to be accommodated inside the EU.
674:They are a homegrown challenge to an entrenched political order, and they are riding a powerful historical current.
675:Remarkably, responsible macroeconomic policy has followed a wave of populist/socialist electoral victories in recent years.
676:The second lesson of perestroika concerns the program of reform.
677:Declaring that "Arab popular resistance" to the American invasion has spread through the region, Assad referred to the increasing numbers of Arab, including Syrian, "volunteers" who have gone to Iraq to fight alongside Saddam's soldiers.

681:There is no shortage of examples.
682:True, Al Qaeda's tentacles reach into many conflicts.

684:But, on closer inspection, things are not so simple.
685:Draghi replaced Antonio Fazio, whose corrupt protectionist practices in Italy's banking sector had both discouraged capital from coming into Italy and depressed the euro.
686:No doubt, Putin is now likely to behave like a peacemaker.
687:America's macroeconomic situation is also worrisome.
688:Taming our radicals, and the radical impulse, has not been easy.
689:Iraq's Potemkin Government
690:Unlike workers or peasants, students include people from all levels of society, so whatever mobilizes them represents society's focus at that time.
691:So if the settlers have a right to self‑defense, is the fence an acceptable means of realizing that right?
692:The paradox of Brazil's current corruption scandal, and of the widespread corruption of the Mexican left in Mexico City, is that the advent of democracy, which has unveiled, documented, and focused attention on corruption, is largely a product of the left's struggle over the past two decades in both countries.
693:External factors will be critical in determining where Turkey ends up.
694:The cycle thus takes another vicious turn: higher interest rates, continuing currency appreciation, further decimation of the tradeables sector, and the risk of more unemployment.
695:Yushchenko is careful not to criticize oligarchs but "bandits" and corruption, because smaller oligarchs support him.
696:Sovereign debt, needed by all countries, but particularly by the poorest, suffers profoundly from erratic interest-rate and exchange-rate movements. The absence of a lender of last resort in today's world only magnifies the threat involved in each crisis.
697:4.
698:The postwar architecture of German foreign policy has been made up of several bridges--to the United States, to France, to Britain, to smaller EU member states, to Central and Eastern Europe, and to Russia.
699:Compared to public opinion in 1960, that's certainly an enormous progress.
700:If those who hold power fear that change may bring unpleasant consequences, they will systematically obstruct it, which rulers in the Middle East proceeded to do for centuries.
701:Only by doing so can the Union achieve a more credible foreign and security policy and become a serious partner for the United States, its neighbors, and the rest of the world.
702:Southeast Asia's Widening Arms Race
703:The way to deal with uncertainty and complex situations is to think clearly and act decisively, not cut deals that place Ukraine's future in the hands of shadowy businesses.
704:Such criticism notwithstanding, Friedman makes an important point.
705:The United Nations Security Council has taken these meetings seriously and has requested further regional cooperation on the Iraqi question.
706:Does this mean that a hurricane could hit world financial markets at any moment?
707:How does one separate the terrorist parasite from its unwilling host, without doing fatal violence to the patient?
708:As far back as 1873, in his classic book on central banking, Lombard Street , Walter Bagehot noted that central banks should be able to prevent financial panics by injecting liquidity into the economy.
709:This will involve far more than just the usual regional actors and conflicts.
710:What was not predicted was the size of the victory for this so-called "party of power," or the exceedingly poor showing by the Communist Party (KPRF).
711:So why prefer one genetic potential over the other?
712:The Other War That Should Be Stopped
713:Maybe real estate prices are unlikely to fall to pre-boom levels because the fundamental change in perceptions concerning capitalism's triumph will be longstanding.
714:While these expect little from an often indifferent France, they still, as the discussions in Riga suggest, would be disposed to putting their trust in Germany -- if only German governments once again show they care.
715:The most obvious solution is to increase the number of permanent members from five to eight or nine (including Germany, Japan, India and possibly Brazil) and to change the voting rules, so that two or three permanent members--rather than just one--are needed to block an action.
716:More precisely, Castro limits Cubans.
717:It lasted 50 days and was heartily supported by Beijing residents and people all around the country, from all walks of life.
718:High taxation supports comprehensive national health care, education, pensions, and other social services, resulting in low levels of poverty and a relatively narrow income gap between the richest and poorest households.
719:The main glitch in this scenario, however, is Lewites.
720:Live Long and Prosper
721:The question of whether to meet with nasty but powerful people has dogged diplomacy since its inception, and both ends of the question have been argued endlessly -- and inconclusively.
722:The underlying idea is simple: every year, countries around the world set aside reserves as insurance against contingencies such as an abrupt downturn in foreign lenders' sentiment or a collapse of export prices.
723:International covenants, the Bush Administration conveyed, are maybe all right for lesser powers - but they are an unacceptable restriction on the freedom of action of the world's only superpower.
724:Since everyone carries some adverse genes, there is no clear line between selecting against a child with above-average risks of contracting a disease and selecting for a child with unusually rosy health prospects.
725:The constitution of liberty requires both, and the rule of law is the more difficult of the two to establish and maintain, for it requires not just a constitution but, almost more importantly, an independent judiciary that is sensitive to violations of constitutional and other legitimate rules.
726:The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed.
727:It is thus hardly surprising that commentaries about avian flu often miss the mark.
728:Even though a consensus had emerged in the Council that a December interest rate hike would be necessary, a handful of holdouts on the ECB Governing Council -- some with their own very private agendas -- leaked misleading and, in one instance, clearly false information to the press in a futile attempt to thwart the increase.
729:Russia is living through the deepest, most prolonged crisis in modern history.
730:The challenge to workers, employers, governments, and communities is to translate what we now know into coordinated and sustainable programs.
731:A recent study conducted in China, including 862 patients who were between the second and tenth day after onset of acute stroke, is the largest truly randomized trial using death or dependency as the primary outcome.
732:Japan's vacation-home boom of the 1980's has largely fizzled with its collapsing stock market and urban land market.
733:It was the Red Army's biggest defeat.
734:Hopes for a development round in world trade -- opening up opportunities for developing countries to grow and reduce poverty -- now seem dashed.
735:Last but not least, we need food policies for the long term. One Europe with the highest standards of food safety.
736:But that miracle will not materialize in Mainz.
737:Given the gravity of the accusations, and the abundance of evidence against him, Ríos Montt should be on his way to prison.
738:But including social policy among the shared competences of the Union is potentially much more serious.
739:Democracy carries certain costs, but they are always lower than the costs of evading popular participation.
740:Thanks to agreements between the rebels and the government that Nelson Mandela and South African Vice President Jacob Zuma helped broker, Burundi can now either turn decisively away from civil strife, or risk a return to the machete politics that have mauled Africa's Great Lakes region for a decade.
741:It was also costly in terms of our soft power to attract others.
742:If these three fail to agree in a crisis, Europe will be opting out; if united on taking action, Europe will be committed.
743:But the desire for dignity is not enough to secure it.
744:The preamble of the Constitution states that Europe is "united in its diversity."
745:Is it supporting real development needs, such as growing more food, fighting disease, or building transport, energy, and communications infrastructure?
746:But perhaps this is irrelevant.
747:Moreover, Russia's default and devaluation in 1998 undermined the progress that was accomplished -- starting in 1996 -- in the banking sector and the capital markets in general.
748:Brazilian bonds would rally and confidence would return at the sight of a lender of last resort.
749:The result is even more corruption and less growth in a sort of "corruption-induced" poverty trap.
750:A sense of alienation towards the West is spreading, and Turkey's diplomatic relations with Russia have reached a hitherto unknown intimacy.
751:But that audience exists because of the deep dissatisfaction and anger of so many young Muslims everywhere.
752:To some, making such priorities seems obscene.
753:Such attempts at blame-shifting are misguided: one can understand the default as the consequence of economic mistakes made over a decade.
754:Corruption and incompetence have forged a state in which tens of millions of lives lay broken and hopeless; where vast swathes of the economy are in ruin; where internal and external debts multiply into many billions of dollars; and where an inept army of corrupt bureaucrats presides over a government that cannot meet the most elementary needs of Ukraine's people.
755:Democratization can surely help remove some of the sources of rage that fuel terrorism, but it is only part of the solution.
756:Nothing would be gained by breaking with Russia and engaging in confrontation with it, but there is no reason not to respond to Realpolitik with Realpolitik.
757:The terrorism that we have come to associate with Al Qaeda is special in many ways.
758:The same is true if the British economy and the Euro-zone economy are both doing badly.
759:Stock market volatility was also very low during the early 1990's, before reaching new peaks later in the decade.
